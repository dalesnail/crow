    <strong>crow manages files - mostly .dot files</strong>

#### *Note - this is in testing currently, so it may be buggy. Also always back up any files managed through crow, even though there should not be any danger to them. I will be writing in a backup feature for the dots at some point, so we don't have to worry about this.*

---

### Workflow:
#### To add a file to crow for management:
- `crow -a YourAlias -s ~/path/to/your/file.conf`
- You can now open this file with `crow -a YourAlias`

This feature is essentially like adding an alias to your .bashrc

_When you create your first alias, your "crowfile" will be generated. This file will hold all of your aliases, as well as your default editor you would like for your files to be opened in. After creating your alias, `crow -a crowfile` will open your crowfile, and you can change what editor you will use. It defaults to Vim currently._

----
#### To pull those files into your "nest":
- `crow -P YourAlias`

This will create the necessary subfolders for the config file at '~/nest' and move the file listed for the alias to the appropriate subfolder.

This is where [gnustow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) ðŸ“¦ comes into play. Simply `cd ~/nest` and `stow YourAlias`

This should create a symlink where the file was originally located, keeping your configuration intact without having to make a copy in another folder. 

After this, simply `git init` your nest, and manage through github, gitlab, etc.

---
#### Groups!
Groups are for managing a subset of files, rather than one single file. An example might be managing all of your X files (_I want to believe ðŸ‘½_). Simply set up a group name for the files, in the example we will call it xgroup. 

To establish the group:

- `crow -G xgroup`

This will write the group alias to your crowfile, and will create a sub-directory with the groups name in your nest. 

To pull files into that sub-directory:
- `crow -a filealias -g xgroup`

After the group is set and the files are pulled in, stow it same as any other alias directory:

- `cd ~/nest`
- `stow xgroup`

Another good example use for this would be to establish system config "Profiles" to deploy whenever you feel like trying or creating a new config. Just establish a group directory: `crow -G Profile1`, stow all of your current configs in it with crow, push out the entire directory with stow, and when you feel like trying another setup, just `stow -D Profile1 && stow Profile2`.  

_Experiment, but be careful._

### Updates and things to change

_Got group functionality going. Once you set a group with `crow -G GroupAlias` you can now use `crow -a FileAlias -g GroupAlias` to move that file into the group folder._
